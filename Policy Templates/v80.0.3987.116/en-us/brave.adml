Any ID that is omitted is treated as a wildcard with one exception, and that exception is that a product ID cannot be specified without a vendor ID also being specified.

The requesting URL may be different than the embedding URL when the requesting site is loaded in an iframe. Therefore, the &quot;urls&quot; field can contain up to two URL strings delimited by a comma to specify the requesting and embedding URL respectively. If only one URL is specified, then access to the corresponding USB devices will be granted when the requesting site's URL matches this URL regardless of embedding status.

Extensions already installed will be disabled if blacklisted, without a way for the user to enable them. Once an extension disabled due to the blacklist is removed from it, it will automatically get re-enabled.

A blacklist value of '*' means all extensions are blacklisted unless they are explicitly listed in the whitelist.

If this policy is left not set the user can install any extension in Brave.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallBlacklistDesc">Configure extension installation blacklist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelist">Configure extension installation whitelist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelist_Explain">Allows you to specify which extensions are not subject to the blacklist.

A blacklist value of * means all extensions are blacklisted and users can only install extensions listed in the whitelist.

By default, all extensions are whitelisted, but if all extensions have been blacklisted by policy, the whitelist can be used to override that policy.

Example value:

extension_id1
extension_id2</string><string id="ExtensionInstallWhitelistDesc">Configure extension installation whitelist</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelist_Explain">Specifies a list of apps and extensions that are installed silently,
without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled nor
disabled by the user. All permissions requested by the
apps/extensions are granted implicitly, without user interaction,
including any additional permissions requested by future versions of
the app/extension. Furthermore, permissions are granted for the
enterprise.deviceAttributes and enterprise.platformKeys extension
APIs. (These two APIs are not available to apps/extensions that are
not force-installed.)

This policy takes precedence over a potentially conflicting ExtensionInstallBlacklist policy. If an app or extension that previously had been force-installed is removed from this list, it is automatically uninstalled by Brave.

For Windows instances that are not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Brave Web Store.

Note that the source code of any extension may be altered by users via Developer Tools (potentially rendering the extension dysfunctional). If this is a concern, the DeveloperToolsDisabled policy should be set.

Each list item of the policy is a string that contains an extension ID and, optionally, an &quot;update&quot; URL separated by a semicolon (;). The extension ID is the 32-letter string found e.g. on Brave://extensions when in developer mode. The &quot;update&quot; URL, if specified, should point to an Update Manifest XML document as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate. By default, the Chrome Web Store's update URL is used (which currently is &quot;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx&quot;). Note that the &quot;update&quot; URL set in this policy is only used for the initial installation; subsequent updates of the extension employ the update URL indicated in the extension's manifest. Note also that specifying the &quot;update&quot; URL explicitly was mandatory in Brave versions up to and including 67.

For example, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx installs the extension with id aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa from the standard Chrome Web Store &quot;update&quot; URL. For more information about hosting extensions, see: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/hosting.

If this policy is left not set, no apps or extensions are installed automatically and the user can uninstall any app or extension in Brave.

Note that this policy doesn't apply to incognito mode.

Example value:

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa;https://clients2.google.com/service/update2/crx
abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop</string><string id="ExtensionInstallForcelistDesc">Configure the list of force-installed apps and extensions</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSources_Explain">Allows you to specify which URLs are allowed to install extensions, apps, and themes.

Starting in Brave 21, it is more difficult to install extensions, apps, and user scripts from outside the Chrome Web Store. Previously, users could click on a link to a *.crx file, and Brave would offer to install the file after a few warnings. After Brave 21, such files must be downloaded and dragged onto the Brave settings page. This setting allows specific URLs to have the old, easier installation flow.

Each item in this list is an extension-style match pattern (see https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns). Users will be able to easily install items from any URL that matches an item in this list. Both the location of the *.crx file and the page where the download is started from (i.e. the referrer) must be allowed by these patterns.

ExtensionInstallBlacklist takes precedence over this policy. That is, an extension on the blacklist won't be installed, even if it happens from a site on this list.

Example value:

https://corp.mycompany.com/*</string><string id="ExtensionInstallSourcesDesc">Configure extension, app, and user script install sources</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypes_Explain">Controls which app/extension types are allowed to be installed and limits runtime access.

This setting white-lists the allowed types of extension/apps that can be installed in Brave and which hosts they can interact with. The value is a list of strings, each of which should be one of the following: &quot;extension&quot;, &quot;theme&quot;, &quot;user_script&quot;, &quot;hosted_app&quot;, &quot;legacy_packaged_app&quot;, &quot;platform_app&quot;. See the Brave extensions documentation for more information on these types.

Note that this policy also affects extensions and apps to be force-installed via ExtensionInstallForcelist.

If this setting is configured, extensions/apps which have a type that is not on the list will not be installed.

If this settings is left not-configured, no restrictions on the acceptable extension/app types are enforced.

Prior to version 75 using multiple comma separated extension IDs is not supported and will be skipped. The rest of the policy will continue to apply.

Example value:

hosted_app</string><string id="ExtensionAllowedTypesDesc">Configure allowed app/extension types</string><string id="ExtensionSettings">Extension management settings</string><string id="ExtensionSettings_Explain">Configures extension management settings for Brave.

This policy controls multiple settings, including settings controlled by any existing extension-related policies. This policy will override any legacy policies if both are set.

This policy maps an extension ID or an update URL to its configuration. With an extension ID, configuration will be applied to the specified extension only. A default configuration can be set for the special ID &quot;*&quot;, which will apply to all extensions that don't have a custom configuration set in this policy. With an update URL, configuration will be applied to all extensions with the exact update URL stated in manifest of this extension, as described at https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/autoupdate.

For Windows instances that are not joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain, forced installation is limited to apps and extensions listed in the Chrome Web Store.

See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=ExtensionSettings for more information about schema and formatting.

When this policy is set, each item is treated as a rule for something to open in an alternative browser. Brave uses those rules when choosing if a URL should open in an alternative browser.

When the Internet Explorer add-in is present and enabled, Internet Explorer switches back to Brave when the rules do not match.

If rules contradict eachother, Brave uses the most specific rule.

When this policy is left unset, no websites are added to the list.

When this policy is set, each item is treated as a rule, similar to the BrowserSwitcherUrlList policy. However, the logic is reversed: rules that match will not open an alternative browser.

Unlike BrowserSwitcherUrlList, rules apply to both directions. That is, when the Internet Explorer add-in is present and enabled, it also controls whether Internet Explorer should open these URLs in Brave.

This policy determines the rules for selecting the default printer in Brave which happens the first time the print function is used with a profile.

When this policy is set, Brave will attempt to find a printer matching all of the specified attributes, and select it as default printer. The first printer found matching the policy is selected, in case of non-unique match any matching printer can be selected, depending on the order printers are discovered.

If this policy is not set or matching printer is not found within the timeout, the printer defaults to built-in PDF printer or no printer selected, when PDF printer is not available.

Printers connected to Google Cloud Print are considered &quot;cloud&quot;, the rest of the printers are classified as &quot;local&quot;.
Omitting a field means all values match, for example, not specifying connectivity will cause Print Preview to initiate the discovery of all kinds of printers, local and cloud.
Regular expression patterns must follow the JavaScript RegExp syntax and matches are case sensistive.

Placing all printer types on the deny list effectively disables printing, as there would be no available destinations to send a document for printing.

Including cloud on the deny list has the same effect as setting the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy to false. In order to keep Google Cloud Print destinations discoverable, the CloudPrintSubmitEnabled policy must be set to true and cloud must not be on the deny list.

If the policy is not set, or is set to an empty list, all printer types will be available for discovery.

It allows you to specify if the user can sign in to Brave with their account and use account related services like Brave sync.

If the policy is set to &quot;Disable browser sign-in&quot; then the user can not sign in to the browser and use account based services. In this case browser level features like Brave sync can not be used and will be unavailable. If the user was signed in and the policy is set &quot;Disabled&quot; they will be signed out the next time they run Brave but their local profile data like bookmarks, passwords etc. will stay preserved. The user will still be able to sign into and use Google web services like Gmail.

If the policy is set to &quot;Enable browser sign-in,&quot; then the user is allowed to sign in to the browser and is automatically signed in to the browser when signed in to Google web services like Gmail. Being signed in to the browser means the user's account information will be kept by the browser. However, it does not mean that Brave sync will be turned on per default; the user must separately opt-in to use this feature. Enabling this policy will prevent the user from turning off the setting that allows browser sign-in. To control the availability of Brave sync, use the &quot;SyncDisabled&quot; policy.

If the policy is set to &quot;Force browser sign-in&quot; the user is presented with an account selection dialog and has to choose and sign in to an account to use the browser. This ensures that for managed accounts the policies associated with the account are applied and enforced. By default this turns on Brave sync for the account, except for the case when sync was disabled by the domain admin or via the &quot;SyncDisabled&quot; policy. The default value of BrowserGuestModeEnabled will be set to false. Note that existing unsigned profiles will be locked and inaccessible after enabling this policy. For more information, see help center article: https://support.google.com/Brave/a/answer/7572556.

This does not affect which DNS servers are used; just the software stack which is used to communicate with them. For example if the operating system is configured to use an enterprise DNS server, that same server would be used by the built-in DNS client. It is however possible that the built-in DNS client will address servers in different ways by using more modern DNS-related protocols such as DNS-over-TLS.

If this policy is set to true, the built-in DNS client will be used, if available.

If this policy is set to false, the built-in DNS client will never be used.

If this policy is left not set, the built-in DNS client will be enabled by default on MacOS, Android (when neither Private DNS nor VPN are enabled) and ChromeOS, and the users will be able to change whether the built-in DNS client is used by editing Brave://flags or specifying a command-line flag.</string><string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas">Disable Certificate Transparency enforcement for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes</string><string id="CertificateTransparencyEnforcementDisabledForCas_Explain">Disables enforcing Certificate Transparency requirements for a list of subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, one of the following conditions must be met:
1. The hash is of the server certificate's subjectPublicKeyInfo.
2. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, that CA certificate is constrained via the X.509v3 nameConstraints extension, one or more directoryName nameConstraints are present in the permittedSubtrees, and the directoryName contains an organizationName attribute.
3. The hash is of a subjectPublicKeyInfo that appears in a CA certificate in the certificate chain, the CA certificate has one or more organizationName attributes in the certificate Subject, and the server's certificate contains the same number of organizationName attributes, in the same order, and with byte-for-byte identical values.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is &quot;sha256&quot;.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

This policy allows disabling Certificate Transparency disclosure requirements for certificate chains that contain certificates with one of the specified subjectPublicKeyInfo hashes. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used for Enterprise hosts.

In order for Certificate Transparency enforcement to be disabled when this policy is set, the hash must be of a subjectPublicKeyInfo appearing in a CA certificate that is recognized as a Legacy Certificate Authority (CA). A Legacy CA is a CA that has been publicly trusted by default one or more operating systems supported by Brave, but is not trusted by the Android Open Source Project or Brave OS.

A subjectPublicKeyInfo hash is specified by concatenating the hash algorithm name, the &quot;/&quot; character, and the Base64 encoding of that hash algorithm applied to the DER-encoded subjectPublicKeyInfo of the specified certificate. This Base64 encoding is the same format as an SPKI Fingerprint, as defined in RFC 7469, Section 2.4. Unrecognized hash algorithms are ignored. The only supported hash algorithm at this time is &quot;sha256&quot;.

This policy allows certificates for the hostnames in the specified URLs to not be disclosed via Certificate Transparency. This allows certificates that would otherwise be untrusted, because they were not properly publicly disclosed, to continue to be used, but makes it harder to detect misissued certificates for those hosts.

A URL pattern is formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format. However, because certificates are valid for a given hostname independent of the scheme, port, or path, only the hostname portion of the URL is considered. Wildcard hosts are not supported.

If this policy is not set, any certificate that is required to be disclosed via Certificate Transparency will be treated as untrusted if it is not disclosed according to the Certificate Transparency policy.

Cached proxy credentials will be reused across sites.

If the policy is enabled, HTTP auth credentials entered in the context of one site will automatically be used in the context of another.

Enabling this policy leaves sites open to some types of cross-site attacks, and allows users to be tracked across sites even without cookies by adding entries to the HTTP auth cache using credentials embedded in URLs.

The policy consists of a list of bookmarks whereas each bookmark is a dictionary containing the keys &quot;name&quot; and &quot;url&quot; which hold the bookmark's name and its target. A subfolder may be configured by defining a bookmark without an &quot;url&quot; key but with an additional &quot;children&quot; key which itself contains a list of bookmarks as defined above (some of which may be folders again). Brave amends incomplete URLs as if they were submitted via the Omnibox, for example &quot;google.com&quot; becomes &quot;https://google.com/&quot;.

These bookmarks are placed in a folder that can't be modified by the user (but the user can choose to hide it from the bookmark bar). By default the folder name is &quot;Managed bookmarks&quot; but it can be customized by adding to the list of bookmarks a dictionary containing the key &quot;toplevel_name&quot; with the desired folder name as the value.

Managed bookmarks are not synced to the user account and can't be modified by extensions.

The policy specifies a list of origins (URLs) or hostname patterns (such
as &quot;*.example.com&quot;) for which security restrictions on insecure origins
will not apply.

The intent is to allow organizations to set whitelist origins for legacy
applications that cannot deploy TLS, or to set up a staging server for
internal web development so that their developers can test out features
requiring secure contexts without having to deploy TLS on the staging
server. This policy will also prevent the origin from being labeled
&quot;Not Secure&quot; in the omnibox.

Setting a list of URLs in this policy has the same effect as setting the
command-line flag '--unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure' to a
comma-separated list of the same URLs. If the policy is set, it will
override the command-line flag.

This policy will override UnsafelyTreatInsecureOriginAsSecure, if present.

Over this time period, the user will be repeatedly informed of the need for an update. For Brave OS devices, a restart notification appears in the system tray according to the RelaunchHeadsUpPeriod policy. For Brave browsers, the app menu changes to indicate that a relaunch is needed once one third of the notification period passes. This notification changes color once two thirds of the notification period passes, and again once the full notification period has passed. The additional notifications enabled by the RelaunchNotification policy follow this same schedule.

If set to true or not configured, the user can end processes in the Task Manager.</string><string id="ThirdPartyBlockingEnabled">Enable third party software injection blocking</string><string id="ThirdPartyBlockingEnabled_Explain">If the policy is set to false then third party software will be allowed to inject executable code into Brave's processes. If the policy is unset or set to true then third party software will be prevented from injecting executable code into Brave's processes.

Regardless of the value of this policy, the browser will not currently block third party software from injecting executable code into its processes on a machine that is joined to a Microsoft® Active Directory® domain.</string><string id="TranslateEnabled">Enable Translate</string><string id="TranslateEnabled_Explain">Enables the integrated Google Translate service on Brave.

If you enable this setting, Brave will offer translation functionality to the user by showing an integrated translate toolbar (when appropriate) and a translate option on the right-click context menu.

If you disable this setting, all built-in translate features will be disabled.

If you enable or disable this setting, users cannot change or override this setting in Brave.

If this setting is left not set the user can decide to use this function or not.</string><string id="URLBlacklist">Block access to a list of URLs</string><string id="URLBlacklist_Explain">This policy prevents the user from loading web pages from blacklisted URLs. The blacklist provides a list of URL patterns that specify which URLs will be blacklisted.

A URL pattern has to be formatted according to https://www.chromium.org/administrators/url-blacklist-filter-format.

Exceptions can be defined in the URL whitelist policy. These policies are limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

Note that it is not recommended to block internal 'Brave://*' URLs since this may lead to unexpected errors.

From M73 you can block 'javascript://*' URLs. However, it affects only JavaScript typed in address bar (or, for example, bookmarklets). Note that in-page JavaScript URLs, as long as dynamically loaded data, are not subject to this policy. For example, if you block 'example.com/abc', page 'example.com' will still be able to load 'example.com/abc' via XMLHTTPRequest.

If this policy is not set no URL will be blacklisted in the browser.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/bad_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com
file://*
custom_scheme:*
*</string><string id="URLBlacklistDesc">Block access to a list of URLs</string><string id="URLWhitelist">Allow access to a list of URLs</string><string id="URLWhitelist_Explain">Allows access to the listed URLs, as exceptions to the URL blacklist.

See the description of the URL blacklist policy for the format of entries of this list.

This policy can be used to open exceptions to restrictive blacklists. For example, '*' can be blacklisted to block all requests, and this policy can be used to allow access to a limited list of URLs. It can be used to open exceptions to certain schemes, subdomains of other domains, ports, or specific paths.

The most specific filter will determine if a URL is blocked or allowed. The whitelist takes precedence over the blacklist.

This policy is limited to 1000 entries; subsequent entries will be ignored.

If this policy is not set there will be no exceptions to the blacklist from the 'URLBlacklist' policy.

Example value:

example.com
https://ssl.server.com
hosting.com/good_path
https://server:8080/path
.exact.hostname.com</string><string id="URLWhitelistDesc">Allow access to a list of URLs</string><string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled">Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection</string><string id="UrlKeyedAnonymizedDataCollectionEnabled_Explain">Enable URL-keyed anonymized data collection in Brave and prevents users from changing this setting.

URL-keyed anonymized data collection sends URLs of pages the user visits to Google to make searches and browsing better.

If you enable this policy, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is always active.

If you disable this policy, URL-keyed anonymized data collection is never active.

If this policy is left not set, URL-keyed anonymized data collection will be enabled but the user will be able to change it.</string><string id="UserDataDir">Set user data directory</string><string id="UserDataDir_Explain">Configures the directory that Brave will use for storing user data.

If you set this policy, Brave will use the provided directory regardless whether the user has specified the '--user-data-dir' flag or not. To avoid data loss or other unexpected errors this policy should not be set to a volume's root directory or to a directory used for other purposes, because Brave manages its contents.

See https://www.chromium.org/administrators/policy-list-3/user-data-directory-variables for a list of variables that can be used.

If this policy is left not set the default profile path will be used and the user will be able to override it with the '--user-data-dir' command line flag.

Example value: ${users}/${user_name}/Brave</string><string id="UserFeedbackAllowed">Allow user feedback</string><string id="UserFeedbackAllowed_Explain">Allow user feedback.
If the policy is set to false, users can not send feedback to Google.

If the policy is unset or set to true, users can send feedback to Google via Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;Report an Issue or key combination.</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowed">Allow or deny video capture</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowed_Explain">If enabled or not configured (default), the user will be prompted for
video capture access except for URLs configured in the
VideoCaptureAllowedUrls list which will be granted access without prompting.

When this policy is disabled, the user will never be prompted and video
capture only be available to URLs configured in VideoCaptureAllowedUrls.

This policy affects all types of video inputs and not only the built-in camera.</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrls_Explain">Patterns in this list will be matched against the security
origin of the requesting URL.  If a match is found, access to video
capture devices will be granted without prompt.

NOTE: Until version 45, this policy was only supported in Kiosk mode.

Example value:

https://www.example.com/
https://[*.]example.edu/</string><string id="VideoCaptureAllowedUrlsDesc">URLs that will be granted access to video capture devices without prompt</string><string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled">Enable WPAD optimization</string><string id="WPADQuickCheckEnabled_Explain">Allows to turn off WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) optimization in Brave.

If this policy is set to false, WPAD optimization is disabled causing Brave to wait longer for DNS-based WPAD servers.  If the policy is not set or is enabled, WPAD optimization is enabled.

Independent of whether or how this policy is set, the WPAD optimization setting cannot be changed by users.</string><string id="WebAppInstallForceList">Configure list of force-installed Web Apps</string><string id="WebAppInstallForceList_Explain">Specifies a list of websites that are installed silently, without user interaction, and which cannot be uninstalled nor disabled by the user.

Each list item of the policy is an object with a mandatory member: &quot;url&quot; and two optional members: &quot;default_launch_container&quot; and &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot;. &quot;url&quot; should be the URL of the web app to install, &quot;launch_container&quot; should be either &quot;window&quot; or &quot;tab&quot; to indicate how the Web App will be opened once installed, and &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot; should be true if a desktop shortcut should be created on Linux and Windows. If &quot;default_launch_container&quot; is omitted, the app will open in a tab by default. Regardless of the value of &quot;default_launch_container&quot;, users are able to change which container the app will open in. If &quot;create_desktop_shortcuts&quot; is omitted, no desktop shortcuts will be created. See PinnedLauncherApps policy for pinning apps to the ChromeOS shelf.
See https://cloud.google.com/docs/chrome-enterprise/policies/?policy=WebAppInstallForceList for more information about schema and formatting.


Example value:

[
  {
    &quot;url&quot;: &quot;https://www.google.com/maps&quot;, 
    &quot;create_desktop_shortcut&quot;: true, 
    &quot;default_launch_container&quot;: &quot;window&quot;

]</string><string id="WebComponentsV0Enabled">Re-enable Web Components v0 API until M84.</string><string id="WebComponentsV0Enabled_Explain">The Web Components v0 APIs (Shadow DOM v0, Custom Elements v0, and HTML Imports) were deprecated in 2018, and have been disabled by default starting in M80. This policy allows these features to be selectively re-enabled until M84.

     If this policy is set to True, the Web Components v0 features will be enabled for all sites.

     If this policy is set to False or not set, the Web Components v0 features will be disabled by default, starting in M80.

     This policy will be removed after Brave 84.</string><string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed">Allow collection of WebRTC event logs from Google services</string><string id="WebRtcEventLogCollectionAllowed_Explain">
If the policy is set to true, Brave is allowed to collect WebRTC event logs from Google services (e.g. Google Meet), and upload those logs to Google.

If the policy is set to false, Brave may not collect nor upload such logs.

If the policy is unset, up to and including M76, Brave may not collect nor upload such logs.

If the policy is unset, since M77, Brave may collect or upload such logs by default if the browser profile is considered managed, i.e. if the profile receives cloud or machine level policies, and is not a child, ephemeral, login, or incognito profile.

These logs contain diagnostic information helpful when debugging issues with audio or video calls in Brave, such as the time and size of sent and received RTP packets, feedback about congestion on the network, and metadata about time and quality of audio and video frames. These logs do not contain audio or video contents from the call.

This data collection by Brave can only be triggered by Google's web services, such as Google Hangouts or Google Meet.

Google may associate these logs, by means of a session ID, with other logs collected by the Google service itself; this is intended to make debugging easier.
</string><string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls">URLs for which local IPs are exposed in WebRTC ICE candidates</string><string id="WebRtcLocalIpsAllowedUrls_Explain">Patterns in this list will be matched against the security origin of the requesting URL.
If a match is found or Brave://flags/#enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns is Disabled, the local IP addresses are shown in WebRTC ICE candidates.
Otherwise, local IP addresses are concealed with mDNS hostnames.
Please note that this policy weakens the protection of local IPs if needed by administrators.
